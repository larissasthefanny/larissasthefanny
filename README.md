## 👩‍💻 Who I am

Senior Software Engineer with deep experience building **scalable, resilient backend systems**, especially in **fintech contexts**.  
I focus on clean, maintainable design and real-world performance — not just code that works, but code that *survives production chaos*.

I love making complex systems:
- reliable  
- observable
